# Soft Dorothy Software: Unfinished Tales (Vol 1)
The first part of a collection of **Soft Dorothy Software** scraps and game experiments from the late 80's and early 90's.

I wrote a shareware game for the Macintosh computer around 1988 called **Glider**. For a number of years that followed I spent a good deal of my conscious hours (and perhaps unconscious hours as well) progamming little games for my amusement. I think the little Macintosh Plus with crisp black and white pixels, curious mouse interface, became a new kind of canvas for me. I don't think I was *naturally* a programmer, programming was a means to an end — an end I suppose that consisted of little games that I approached as a kind of art.

To be clear the games had to be fun as well, If you allow at least that computer games have an art *aspect* it's of course not the kind of art you hang on the wall.

To that end I often "sketched" out a game fairly quickly sometimes to find fairly early on that it was not to be. Perhaps the game seemed like it had potential but it was going to consume a year of my life to write it. Sometimes though the game just wasn't grabbing me — was simply missing something compelling to make it enjoyable.

I suspect my personality is to reject "lost ideas" quickly where someone else might have spent more time trying to nurture them. Perhaps then there were some diamonds in the rough.

Regardless, if for some of the pixel art alone, it may have been worth it recovering these prototype games and experiments.

### Bundle Identifiers

The old Macintosh OS (before OS X) used four-character codes to identify each application. These were called bundle identifiers. Beginning with **Glider** I established a pattern for my own game's bundle identifiers. The first two characters were lower-case: `sd` while the last two were digits beginning, with **Glider**, `01`.

I found on one of my recovered hard drives a document listing the titles and bundle identifiers I had used. Here is the beginning of the list:

```
sd01 = Glider        v.1.0/2.0/2.02ß/3.0          +++
sd02 = La Luna       not distributed
sd03 = Reaction      not distributed
sd04 = BlackBox      not distributed
sd05 = Paria         incomplete <slow, complex>
sdHM = Harmonigraph  not distributed
sd08 = FishTank      not distributed-K
sd09 = Glypha        v.1.0/2.0                    +++
sd10 = Mobocracy     incomplete <time-consuming>
```

It begins of course with `sd01` for **Glider**. If you had a Macintosh back in the 1990's you might recognize `sd09`, **Glypha**. The bundle identifiers listed in between though belonged to programs that never left my hard drive.

To the degree I am able to, this repo represents those "lost" experiments. We'll skip Glider & Glypha of course — they're already in a repo called **SoftDorothy-SharewareProjects**.
