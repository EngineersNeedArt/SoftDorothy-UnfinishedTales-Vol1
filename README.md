I wrote a shareware game for the Macintosh computer around 1988 called **Glider**. For a number of years that followed I spent a good deal of my conscious hours (and perhaps unconscious hours as well) progamming little games for my amusement. I think the little Macintosh Plus with crisp black and white pixels, curious mouse interface, became a new kind of canvas for me. I don't think I was *naturally* a programmer, programming was a means to an end — an end I suppose that consisted of little games that I approached as a kind of art.

To be clear the games had to be fun as well, If you allow at least that computer games have an art *aspect* it's of course not the kind of art you hang on the wall.

To that end I often "sketched" out a game fairly quickly sometimes to find fairly early on that it was not to be. Perhaps the game seemed like it had potential but it was going to consume a year of my life to write it. Sometimes though the game just wasn't grabbing me — was simply missing something compelling to make it enjoyable.

I suspect my personality is to reject "lost ideas" quickly where someone else might have spent more time trying to nurture them. Perhaps then there were some diamonds in the rough.

Regardless, if for some of the pixel art alone, it may have been worth it recovering these prototype games and experiments.
